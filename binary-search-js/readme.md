# What is Binary Search

Binary search is a searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It begins by comparing the target value to the middle element of the array. If the target is equal to the middle element, then the search is successful and the index of the middle element is returned. If the target is less than the middle element, then the search continues on the lower half of the array. If the target is greater than the middle element, then the search continues on the upper half of the array. This process is repeated until the target is found or the search space is exhausted. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which makes it very efficient for large arrays.

# how this application works    

This program implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of a given letter in the English alphabet. It defines the arr array, which contains all the letters from "a" to "z" in order.

The binarySearch() function takes three parameters: the target letter to be found, and the start and end indices of the portion of the array to be searched. It recursively divides the array in half until it finds the target letter or determines that it is not present.

It first checks if the starting index is greater than the ending index, which means that the target letter is not in the input array. If this condition is met, the function returns the string "not found".

If the starting index is less than or equal to the ending index, the function calculates the middle index by taking the floor of the average of the start and end indices. It then compares the letter at the middle index with the target letter. If they match, the function returns the index of the middle element as a string, indicating that the target letter was found.

If the letter at the middle index is greater than the target letter, the function makes a recursive call on the left half of the section of the array being searched (i.e., between the starting index and the middle index - 1). If the middle element is less than the target letter, the function makes a recursive call on the right half of the section of the array being searched (i.e., between the middle index + 1 and the ending index).

Finally, the code calls the binarySearch() function with the target letter "n", starting index 0, and ending index arr.length - 1, and logs the return value to the console.

Overall, this is an efficient implementation of the binary search algorithm for the given problem, with added error checking to ensure the input parameters are valid.
